        <p class="paragrapi1">Ego has no place in the design process. Fail quickly to succeed quickly. <br>
            Negative feedback is a gift. Universal design is ethical design. <br>
            Designers are toolmakers. <br>
            Meet people where they are. Be a facilitator. <br>
            Define the problem. Play. There's always more than one solution. <br>
            Empathy is the key to resonance. You are not your user.</p>
